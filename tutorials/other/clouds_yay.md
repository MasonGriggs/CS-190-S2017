#Google Drive: An overview
  
  We've all been there. Working away on Microsoft Word on some project or essay when your computer decides that it's the perfect 
  time to BSOD (or for you Mac users out there, spinning beach-ball of death), (Linux users, your machines run far too effectively for any kind of death, so move along). 
  Anyway, the deadline is in 15 minutes, so you furiously restart, only to find that Word failed to (as it often does) save your precious work. 
  
  Official course guidelines always recommend using the cloud for a few reasons:
  A) Its free
  B) It auto saves as you type
  C) Accessible on any platform, on any device (Well, Google Drive is at least)
  
  In a situation where your computer fails, you can rely on either a mobile device or another computer to pick up right where you left off.
  In a situation where the WiFi fails, either an Ethernet connection or Mobile Data will save your hind.
  
##How to Google Drive for dummies.
  
  Step1: Get a Google account. If you already use Gmail, you can skip this.
  Step2: Go to https://drive.google.com
  Step3: Try not to gag at sight of the new Google logo
  Step4: Login
  Step5: There's a shiny red button on the Left pane, called 'NEW' click this.
  Step6: Choose to create either a folder, or a document, spreadsheet or presentation
  Step7: Alternatively, upload exisisting folders/files. 
  Step8: Get to work
  Step9: Access your auto-saved files from your main Google Drive window.
  Step10: Download if needed.

  Yes. It is indeed that simple.
  
##Sharing is caring.
  
  One of the things that makes Drive so functionally awesome is the ability to share any files over the net, seamlessly. 
  The person with whom you wish to share said files does not even need a google account to access them.
  To share a pre-existing file, do the following:
  Step1: Right-click on the file
  Step2: Click on share.
  Step3: Enter the email ID of the recipient.
  Step4: Choose their rights; they can either edit or view the file. 
  Step5: Profit.
  
  Alternatively, you can also click on advanced to see the link of the file in drive and share it via social media
  
##Live offline.

  If you prefer the tools on your homedrive, you can always download Google Drive to your computer. 
  It will set up a folder in your quick access. Any files created in this folder will be automatically synced to your Drive for accessibility. 
  To do this,
  Simply google 'Google Drive download' and follow the first link
  This is currently supported for the Mac, PC, Android, iPhone and iPad
  
##Why should I do all this.

  Every course syllabus clearly states that technological failures will not be accepted as excuses for late submissions. 
  Hardware and software are both susceptible to failures at any given time (Yes even macs)
  Not only does using the cloud allow you to access your files in a convenient way, it allows you to manage them in such a way that the changes are instantaneous across all your devices.
  The ease of sharing allows you to share files related to projects, papers, group presentations, even plain-text code if you're not into GitHub. 
  This is useful not only in school but also in a workplace as changes on collaborative projects, online forms, surveys and the like are accesible through this. 
  
##Afterthought.

  These instructions may seem extremely simple, but they are incredibly useful. I cannot list the amount of times that having my project on the cloud has saved my life. 
  If you do not like Google Drive, there are many other options that you can look into. 
  OneDrive by Microsoft to which you can save directly from Office, iCloud by Apple, Purdue even provides it's students with BoilerBackPack, a cloud service connected to your Purdue account.
  
  Remember, cloud computing is safe computing.
