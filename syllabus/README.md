## Course Description

This course is designed to introduce new Computer Science students to various programming tools which will aid them in their Computer Science classes, personal projects, and software development job experiences.

## Course Topics

* Navigating the terminal
* Shell configuration
* Debugging
* Git
* Vim (and maybe some other fun stuff)
* Tips n Tricks

## Learning Outcomes
After successfully completing this course, a student will understand how to:

* Use UNIX/Linux commands for searching and input/output redirection.
* Use terminal commands for searching and input/output redirection.
* Use shells such as sh, csh, ksh, tcsh, bash, zsh.
* Do debugging via print statements and general debugger concepts.
* Use version control via Git and Github, source control, workflow, commit, collaboration, pull, push, creating and pushing a new repository, cloning, branches, merging, and conflicts.
* Use VIM including mouseless navigation, normal/insert mode, copy/paste, search/replace, and saving/quitting.


## Rationale
Several Computer Science courses expect students to use a number of tools, but few have the time or manpower to teach those tools.


## Lecture Notes/Cheat Sheets/Slides

* Please find slides under the [`slides`](https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CS-190-S2017/tree/master/slides) directory. 

## History
This course has been taught each Fall (2013, 2014, and 2015) by USB students supervised by Prof. Dunsmore. It was created by [Tyler Hoffman](https://github.com/tyhoff) as part of the Purdue Undergrad Student Board (USB).
It continues to be run by USB and is therefore entirely student-led. It has been so successful that students in other majors are asking if they can take it.

## Prerequisites 
None.

## Textbooks
None.

## Labs

Labs are mandatory and they will be over topics taught in the previous week's lecture.

## Grading

In this class, you will either get an A or an F. Grading is simple. Each lab is checked for completion. If you complete all labs, you will get an A. In code:

```
if (completeAllLabs) {
    your.Grade = 'A';
}

else your.Grade = 'F';
```
You should be able to complete most labs in class. If you can't complete your lab in class, email it to your specific lab TAs as soon as possible. Take this class seriously, it will help your GPA.

For any questions on this, contact [Jay](mailto:hankinsj@purdue.edu).

## Attendance

You are expected to attend all lectures and labs. If you must miss a class, you are expected to email the instructors and your assigned lab TAs. If you are missing a class due to bereavement, please have necessary paperwork from the Office of the Dean of Students (ODOS).

## Exams
None.

## Honesty, Integrity, & Conduct
See [Spaf's Honesty, Integrity, & Conduct policies](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/cpolicy.html) which are a good standard for all courses at Purdue.

## Campus Emergencies
In the event of a major campus emergency course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised semester calendar. If such unusual circumstances arise, students may determine any such changes by contacting their instructors via email, phone, and/or Blackboard.

Campus emergencies include weather extremes (e.g., tornado, blizzard), HAZMAT (hazardous material) spills or leaks (e.g., gas pipe break, chemical spill), infrastructure problems (e.g., electrical power failures, water quality problems), general safety issues (e.g., person on campus suspected of violent behavior), and pandemic illness.

Students are encouraged to think about personal safety in these circumstances â€” at home, traveling to and from campus, and while on campus. This includes where to go to seek shelter, if needed.

All campus and local emergencies can be reported by dialing 911 on any telephone, or by using one of the Purdue emergency telephones on and near campus (yellow call boxes with blue lights on top).

Emergencies and campus closings will be announced on local media and on the Purdue University emergency preparedness site at https://purdue.edu/ea. Individuals may subscribe to an SMS text announcement service.
